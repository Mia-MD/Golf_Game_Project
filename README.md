# Golf_Game_Project
My final year project for my c√©gep program in Computer Sciences and Mathematics. It simulates real world physics in a 2D golf game and includes multiple levels, each with different varying factors (i.e friction, gravity).

The player must drag the mouse in the desired direction to shoot the ball. The number of shots the ball takes is calculated.
*Note: to see the animations, you  ust be running pygamece*
